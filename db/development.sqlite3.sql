The old filter needed replacement after being used for over 10,000 miles it was yellow at most (Mechanic inspection talk) but I still needed to part with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have ever seen the stock filter it''s about 4 inches thick with a 1/2 inch thick foam padding at the end of the filter. The filter works very well but it''s also very thick and restrictive. This is why for a replacement filter I went with a lifetime K&amp;N Air filter. This filter straight out of the box was just about 1 inch thick but it is an oil air filter. Oiled air filters use oils to capture dust and contaminants from passing through the cotton layer of the filter and going into the engine causing further carbon build-up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Installation was extremely easy, just open the air box and drop it in. The performance increase was easily felt upon WOT (wide open throttle) there is a better response from the amount of air that gets sucked in by the turbo. This definitely was a good decision as the stock airbox does provide really good Cold Air protection and good routing of the atmospheric air. Vroom...whoosh!&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10/10 Satisfaction</span></strong><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10/10 Installation</span></strong></p>\n<p>Overall this is a good choice to get small performance output from such an easy mod.</p>','\n',char(10)),'2024-08-13 04:03:47.050670','2024-08-14 23:49:10.127148');
INSERT INTO posts VALUES(9,'Turbo Flutter',replace('<h4><strong>YES IT DID HAPPEN!</strong>&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>After installing the K&amp;N Air filter and shortly after installing the DV spacer I have gotten a lot of fun from my car without costing more than $100. The other day upon downshifting the car into 2nd gear it revved matched and it caused the spacer to make its whoosh sound. Though I was around 3400 rpm I had to quickly step on the throttle to get past a yellow light but there was traffic so I had to let off the gas quickly it was around 4600rpm when I let go and this time instead of letting out a whoosh, it made the turbo make a fluttering sound as well. If you have never heard of turbo flutter, look it up you will find tons of videos of loud fluttering turbos.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fluttering as fun as it was, did raise some concerns, usually, it''s caused by the airflow passing over the turbine blades in the turbocharger, this is not harmful for the engine but I want to make sure there wasn''t unnecessary re-routing of pressure. As of right now does not happen often but sure it''s fun. I don''t suspect it will be a problem but until it is I will keep my eye on it and have some more fun!</p>\n<p>&lt;edit&gt;<br>So it looks like the DV spacer allows for the turbo flutter sound to surface through the holes. The car will flutter under high partial throttle anywhere past 3000rpm and it does it even louder on an uphill. The sound is a natural sound and would sound even louder if I removed the Turbo muffler.</p>','\n',char(10)),'2024-08-14 20:34:34.357120','2024-08-15 18:24:57.302393');

It was only a 27-minute drive but you already know we got there in 25 lol. I had to wait to pick it up the next day since I ordered it on a Sunday. I received an email that my order was ready and we got ready and left. Once we got to ECS Tuning Headquarters in&nbsp;<strong>Wadsworth, OH</strong> it was fun driving around their huge warehouse to get to the designated curbside pick-up area. We parked and called them and they easily were able to come out and get us our small little 2-lb box. We quickly made it back home to install the part, it was around 6:30 pm so I still had plenty of daylight hours. I chose the black one, this is the DV spacer I purchased:</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.ecstuning.com/b-ecs-parts/vw-audi-atmospheric-diverter-valve-spacer-black-anodized/021828ecs01-01~a/">VW/Audi Atmospheric Diverter Valve Spacer - Black</a><br>Mfg <span class="show-md-desktop">Part</span> #021828ECS01-01ECS <br><span class="show-md-desktop">Part</span> #ES#<span class="esnum">3551283&nbsp;<br></span>Brand&nbsp;<a id="brandLink" title="ECS" href="https://www.ecstuning.com/b-ecs-parts/"><img src="https://assets.ecstuning.com/static/img/brands/ECS.gif" alt="ECS" width="52" height="11"></a></p>\n<h5>Installing</h5>\n<p>Installing the DV spacer was fairly easy.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove the RH wheel\n<ul>\n<li>Remove the caps</li>\n<li>Crack the lug bolts loose</li>\n<li>Jack the car up and align it on the jack stands</li>\n<li>Remove the 5 lug bolts</li>\n<li>Remove the tire without dropping it on the hub (<em>doing this too often could cause issues to your hub/bearing</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remove the splash guard/ belly pan\n<ul>\n<li>T25 it''s about 9 bolts</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remove the Diverter Valve Connector\n<ul>\n<li>These connectors are annoying and tbh I just skipped this step.</li>\n<li>There is a tool you can buy to assist you with removing these connectors if you are interested: <a href="https://www.ecstuning.com/b-schwaben-parts/vag-connector-removal-tool/002916sch01a/">VAG Connect Remove Tool</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remove the 3 DV bolts\n<ul>\n<li>These Were 5mm and the spacing is really tight.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>I suggest using a small grip swivel head 1/4 ratchet with a small 2-inch extension.</li>\n<li>I ended up using a standard 5mm Allen and it worked just fine.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Install the spacer on the DV\n<ul>\n<li>Since I totally did not remove the connector I ended up just tilting the DV spacers towards me and I made sure everything looked healthy on it.</li>\n<li>I then installed the DV spacers, ECS tuning states "...<em>No need to place the DV spacer any particular direction.
